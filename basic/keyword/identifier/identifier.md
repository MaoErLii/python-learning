# conscept of identifier  

## Python Identifiers are user-defined names to represent a variable, function, class, module or any other object  

## Best Practices For Identifier Naming

    ```
** Better have class names starting with a capital letter. All other identifiers should begin with a lowercase letter

** Declare pricate identifiers by using the ('_') underscore as their first letter

** Don't user '_' as the leading and trailing character in an identifier. As Python built-in types already user this notation

** Avoid using naming with only one character. Instead, make meaningful names.

** Can use underscore to combine multiple words to form a sensible name.
